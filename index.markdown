## Projects:
Collin College Hackathon: October 2021 (https://water-wizard.eshaniyer.com)
--- 
Me and Abhiram Nandiragu's goal was to create a website or app to help the ongoing world problem of Climate Change. 
<br> 
We created a tracker for water consumption using an HTML survey. The inputted data would go to a SQL Lite database which, in theory, be accessed to provide
bettter data for helping the cause of climate change.
<br>
The project can be accessed at the URL above, but the SQL database access is broken rendering the project, unusable.
