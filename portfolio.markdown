## Projects:
### **Collin College Hackathon: October 2021** ***<a href="https://water-wizard.eshaniyer.com/" target="_blank">(Link)</a>***.
--- 
<p class="big">
Me and Abhiram Nandiraju were partners for this Hackathon project.
Our goal was to create a website or app to help the ongoing world problem of Climate Change. We created a tracker for water consumption using an HTML survey. The inputted data would go to a SQL Lite database which, in theory, be accessed to provide
bettter data for helping the cause of climate change. The project can be accessed at the URL above, but the SQL database access is broken rendering the project, unusable.

###  ***A Web App for Oncology** (ongoing)*
<p class="big">
I am currently creating A program that can detect **2 or more** different types of cancer. This will be a webapp with an interface, making it a user friendly and applicable in real world situations. I am planning on presenting this in next year's Frisco ISD Science Fair when I am successful.
