## Projects:
### **Collin College Hackathon: October 2021** ***<a href="https://water-wizard.eshaniyer.com/" target="_blank">(Link)</a>***.

<p class="normal">
Me and Abhiram Nandiraju were partners for this Hackathon project.
Our goal was to create a website or app to help the ongoing world problem of Climate Change. Using the Flask framework, we created a tracker for water consumption using a basic HTML survey. The inputted data would go to a SQL Lite database which, in theory, be accessed to provide
better data for helping the cause of climate change. <b>At the end, we managed to placed third overall in a pool of fifteen teams.</b> <i>The project can be accessed at the URL above, but the SQL database access is broken rendering the project, unfortunatly, unusable.</i>
