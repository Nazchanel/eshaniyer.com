## Projects:
### **Collin College Hackathon: October 2021** ***<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220718051958/https://water-wizard.eshaniyer.com/" target="_blank">(Link)</a>***.

<p class="normal">
Me and  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhiram-nandiraju-412016217/" target="_blank">Abhiram Nandiraju</a> were partners for this Hackathon project. Our goal was to create a website or app to help the ongoing world problem of Climate Change. Using the Flask framework, we created a tracker for water consumption using a basic HTML survey. The inputted data would go to a SQL Lite database which, in theory, be accessed to provide better data for helping the cause of climate change. <b>In the end, we placed third overall in a pool of fifteen contestants.</b><i><br><br>The project can be accessed at the URL above, but the SQL database access is broken rendering the project, unfortunately, unusable.</i>

### ***Fake News Detection***
<p class="normal">
This project was my final project for the UT Dallas AI Bootcamp. Using the various ML packages that I learned, I created a program that uses Natural Language Processing to determine if a text is a true or false statement.

### ***HAC Notifier***

<p class="normal">
Uses the power of web scraping to take info from the online grade management service, and check on a user-given intreval, if the grades are changed. Will send you a desktop notification when the intreval has come. 
<br>
Full breakdown of the logic is available at the given GitHub link below.

###  ***A Web App for Oncology** (ongoing)*
<p class="normal">
I am in the process of creating a program that can detect <b>2 or more</b> different types of cancer. This program will be a web app with an interface, making it user-friendly and applicable in real-world situations. I am planning on presenting this at the Frisco ISD Science Fair when I am successful in this endeavour.
